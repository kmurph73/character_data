        "bio": "Born in San Francisco, California is a self-loathing anthropomorphic alcoholic horse currently in his 50s. His acting career peaked when he starred in a successful family sitcom called Horsin' Around in the late 1980s and later The Bojack Horseman Show, an edgier, less successful sitcom which was cancelled in 2007 after just one season. Though he began as a young bright-eyed actor, he has since grown bitter, deeply depressed, and jaded towards Hollywoo and whom he has become post-fame. BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, and desperate need for approval often result in self-destructive actions that devastate those around him. Many of his issues stem from his childhood and issues with his unhappy parents, which the audience is shown through flashbacks. At the end of season 5, BoJack checks into rehab after he developed a drug addiction to prescription painkillers he was on which caused him to strangle his co-star when she tried to take them away from him."

Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his mother Margaret Groening. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three seasons, the Simpson family received their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989."

His grandmother spent 20 years in a Soviet labor camp, hinting that Lenny may have ancestors from the former Soviet Union, or have ancestors who were POWs. Lenny was a member of the Springfield chapter of the Stonecutters secret society (Number 12, outranking Mr. Burns). Lenny seems to have little regard for his own life: \"Quick and pointless, that's the death for me\". Another example of his apathy towards salvation is that he shrugs after being pulled from a ladder which would have seen him and Homer to safety. In \"Mommie Beerest\", Lenny has a magazine cover from the week of his birth, the headline reads 'Bloodbath in Laos' this means his date birth is possibly in March of 1971, in that date Life magazine published on its cover photos of Laotian Civil War.  Lenny is left-handed. He also has a psychiatric disorder, for which he takes medication."
